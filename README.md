# Magic-Squares
Problem Description
Write a C++ program that creates four(4) diï¬€erent N*N magic squares. A square matrix is the arrangement of the numbers 1, 2, ..., N2, in which the sum of rows, columns, and diagonals are the same. The users (i.e., TAs) will specify the size of the square matrix: N. The value N must be an odd number between 3 and 15.

Example Run

For example, you program is expected to run in the following way:

INPUT>> Enter the size of a magic square: 3

OUTPUT>> Magic Square #1 is:

2 7 6 
9 5 1 
4 3 8

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every row: 15 15 15 OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every column: 15 15 15 OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every diagnoal: 15 15

OUTPUT>> Magic Square #2 is:

8 3 4 
1 5 9 
6 7 2

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every row: 15 15 15 

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every column: 15 15 15 

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every diagnoal: 15 15

OUTPUT>> Magic Square #3 is:

8 1 6 
3 5 7 
4 9 2

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every row: 15 15 15 

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every column: 15 15 15 

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every diagnoal: 15 15

OUTPUT>> Magic Square #4 is:

2 9 4 
7 5 3 
6 1 8

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every row: 15 15 15 

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every column: 15 15 15 

OUTPUT>> Checking the sums of every diagnoal: 15 15
